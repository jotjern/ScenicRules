Welcome to ScenicRules!
=======================================

ScenicRules is an autonomous driving benchmark designed to evaluate systems against complex, multi-objective specifications in diverse driving contexts. It integrates the following key features:

- Multi-Objective Specification: Supports the formalization of conflicting driving objectives and explicit priority relations using the `Rulebook <https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09355>`_ framework.
- Abstract Scenario Representation: Leverages the `Scenic <https://scenic-lang.org>`_ probabilistic programming language to model driving contexts in an expressive, compact, and interpretable manner.

ScenicRules is designed and implemented by Kevin Kai-Chun Chang, Ekin Beyazit, Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, Tichakorn Wongpiromsarn, and Sanjit A. Seshia. 
See `our paper <https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2602.16073>`_ for more details.
If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue on `our GitHub repository <https://github.com/BerkeleyLearnVerify/ScenicRules>`_.
